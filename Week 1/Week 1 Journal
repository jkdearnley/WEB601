During our first week in the WEB601, we were introduced to GitHub and how it can/is used in developing websites.
Personally, I had only heard the name, but had never actually known what GitHub was until starting this class, 
and after learning how it is used, I have been a little disappointed in myself for not taking the initiative to have looked into it earlier.

GitHub is essential a social media for developers, somewhere that you can upload your project and both have others collaborate on your work 
as well as collaborate on others work, something I can see being extremely helpeful in cases where you can't get a particular part working correctly
others can jump in and help you out, tidy up your code and even improve it.

We started out by learning how to set up our GitHub accounts as well as the basic functions of the platform and how they work.
Following this, we got setup with Git and VSCode, learning how to connect to our GItHub accounts and download repositories 
to be worked on from our physical machines instead of the browser/website. 
On top of this, we learned basic Git commands, such as commiting our work (saving to our machines) and oushing the changes to GitHub.

Already my interest in web development has grown and I am eager to learn more.
