This week, we learned more about GitHub and the community around it. We also learned more about using
git commands in VSCode, these included copying a repository on to our persnal machines, 
saving them locally, saving changes we've made to the locally 
saved files, using git commit, selecting branch or the master file (git checkout),
and creating a branch within the repository. 

We also learned how to merge a created branch with the master, before pushing to update the
master on GitHub itself.

We then leanred about pull requests, which update the saved files to match the current GitHub master files.
Following this we were split into teams and given the task of designing and building a website, starting from
planning - Storyboard and wireframe.

From there, we had to work together to build this website. I was selected as my teams Git master hosting
 the repository on my account, granting permission to the team as contributors. We split the workload 
 and each member worked on seperate parts of the website, creating their own branches, merging and pushing to
 master once what they had completed and tested their work.

 With this, I can see why GitHub is so widely used among developers, once the team was clear on what sections 
 they were working on, we were able to have a basic website created, in a very short timeframe.
