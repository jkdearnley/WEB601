This week we started the looking into Javascript, a primarily web based coding language. 
I have had minimal experience with coding javascript, however, I have always been interested 
in it due to it being so widely used.

Our first session of the week, we bagan with the basics of javascript, using console.log 
satatements. Simple statements that take information from variables we've set, and 
prints them in the console, eg.

const lastName = "Dearnley"
const fistName = "Jayden"
console.log(firstName)
console.log(lastName)

Resulting int the console printing :
Jayden
Dearnley

We also covered using the console to print answers of simple math related equations,
including: Addition, Subtraction, multiplication, division and Sums, eg.

const numOne = 5
const numTwo = 12
const result = numTwo + numOne
console.log(result)

Printing "17"

The second session, we looked at operators.
Boolean Logic operators, AND, OR & NOT, that are used to make decisions by comparing values
The syntax for these are:
&& (AND)
|| (OR)
!  (NOT)

We then touched on functions, a block of code designed to perform an action/particular task.
This code is executed when something calls it.

The basics of declaring and executing a function is as follows, using the simple
"Hello world" example:

// Defining function
function greet() {
   document.write("Hello, World!");
}
â€‹
// Invoke the function
greet();
